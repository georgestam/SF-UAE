        The Starfish Project brings together years of experience from working with other therapies. We have combined the best from the early pioneering work of these therapies, together with the experiences and lessons we have learned from helping in the recovery of many hundreds of people from stammering over the years.<br></br> Your Starfish training commences with a three-day course. Training on all Starfish courses is on a one to one basis, given by recovering        stammerers. It combines compassion and care throughout in teaching proven successful methods of diaphragmatic retraining (costal breathing), avoidance reduction therapy and positive attitude development.
        <br><br> On a Starfish Project training course, we are ever mindful of the individuality of every stammerer, and that their recovery from stammering will be at their own pace and in their own time. For this reason we always restrict the number of people on a course, to ensure the maximum individual attention.
        <br><br> We have regular breaks during the day, and of course at lunch time, to ensure you stay ‘fresh’. We keep a training day to your maximum input level – not your exhaustion point. Days start at 9 a.m. and finish between 5 and 6 p.m. We want to help you learn control, not to break you!
        <br><br> In the evenings there is plenty of opportunity to practise your new technique in a relaxed social situation and around the table during dinner, together with everyone else on the course, in the hotel restaurant.

      summary_description_html: "<strong>We welcome you to the Starfish Project</strong>,
        we do not promise a non-existent cure for stuttering, we will not try and
        hypnotise you, or sell you and ask you to wear any gadget or device. Our aim
        is to provide decent, effective therapy with free lifetime support, to as
        many people who stutter as possible, to control stuttering. Our aim is to
        provide that therapy without making huge profits out of your misfortune of
        having a Stutter (Stammer). We hope that you find the joy of effortless speech
        with the Starfish Project.<br><br> The Starfish Project has been invited to
        come to the Emirates by Rakan Otaibi a recovering stutterer from Saudi Arabia.
        Rakan became very disillusioned by the way that diaphragmatic retraining (costal
        breathing), was introduced into the U.A.E. by expensive franchised multi-level
        marketing. Rakan believes that the introduction of the Starfish Project will
        help to bring effective, accessible and supported therapy to a greater numbers
        of people who stammer in the region at a decent affordable price. We are planning
        our first course for 2016 to be held in Dubai. Please contact us for more
        details of this course."

      the_starfish_story_description_html: "<p>A man was walking along a deserted
        beach at sunset.<br /><br> As he walked he could see a young boy in the distance,
        as he drew nearer he noticed that the boy kept bending down, picking something
        up and throwing it into the water.<br /><br> Time and again he kept hurling
        things into the ocean.<br/><br> As the man approached even closer, he was
        able to see that the boy was picking up starfish that had been washed up on
        the beach and, one at a time he was throwing them back into the water.<br
        /><br> The man asked the boy what he was doing, the boy replied,&#8221; I
        am throwing these washed up starfish back into the ocean, or else they will
        die through lack of oxygen.<br /><br> &#8220;But&#8221;, said the man, &#8220;You
        can&#8217;t possibly save them all, there are thousands on this beach, and
        this must be happening on hundreds of beaches along the coast. You can&#8217;t
        possibly make a difference.&#8221;<br /><br> The boy smiled, bent down and
        picked up another starfish, and as he threw it back into the sea, he replied
        <strong>&#8220;Made a difference to that one&#8221;</strong></p>"

      what_is_stuttering: What is stuttering
      what_is_stuttering_description_html: <p><strong>Stuttering and Stammering </strong>are
        two different words that are used to describe the same condition. Generally
        speaking &#8216;stuttering&#8217; is used more commonly in North America,
        Australia, and the Middle East while in UK they tend to use the word &#8216;stammering&#8217;.</p>
        <p>We do not know <strong>what causes stuttering</strong>, but research shows
        that a combination of factors is involved. Stammering affects four times as
        many men as women. Statistics show us that approximately 400,000 plus adults
        in the GCC countries stutter, which is about 1% of the adult population.</p>
        <p>It is vital to recognise that everyone who stammers is different, and stammers
        differently. Everyone is an <strong>individual</strong> and any therapy or
        training must respect your individuality. Therefore, every person who stammers
        is potentially an expert on their own stammering. Recognising and always respecting
        these very important facts is the foundation to The Starfish Project and its
        success in helping people in their <strong>recovery from stuttering</strong>.</p>
        <p><b>Stuttering </b>is a <strong>disorder of fluency</strong> that is characterised
        by various behaviours that interfere with the forward flow of speech. While
        all individuals are disfluent to some extent, what differentiates stammerers
        from non-stutterers is the frequency of their disfluency and/or the severity
        of their disfluency. However, the other factor that differentiates stammerers
        from non-stutterers is that almost invariably the disfluencies that the stutterer
        regards as &#8220;stuttering&#8221; are accompanied by a feeling of loss of
        control. It is this loss of control, <em>which can&#8217;t be observed or
        experienced by the listener,</em> that is generally most problematic for the
        stutterer.<br /> <span class="small">(This excellent short definition of stammering
        was written by Robert W. Quesal, Ph.D.Western Illinois University and is reproduced
        here with his permission.) his web site is :- <a href="http://www.wiu.edu/users/mfrwq"
        target="_blank">www.wiu.edu/users/mfrwq</a></span></p> <p><b>Stuttering</b>
        &#8211; is generally characterized by repetitions (sounds, syllables, part-words,
        whole words, phrases), pauses, and prolongations that differ in number and
        severity from those of &#8216;normally fluent&#8217; individuals. Whilst other
        disorders are characterised by disfluent speech, the patterns of disfluency
        in these other disorders differ from that seen in developmental stuttering.</p>
        <p><b>Stuttering</b> &#8211; <strong>however, is not simply a speech difficulty,
        it is a serious communication problem. It can undermine a person&#8217;s self-esteem;
        affect their interaction with others; impede their education and seriously
        hamper employment potential</strong>.</p>
      who_we_are_description_html: The Starfish Project has been helping and supporting
        people who Stutter (Stammer), in the United Kingdom, to gain control of their
        speech since 1998. In those years well over two thousand people have attended
        Starfish training courses <br><br>The project maintains a cost-covering basis
        and keeps to the pledge to keep the course fee at the same amount as it was
        in the beginning. Then we can make courses available to as many people as
        possible and still offer, FREE Lifetime support and no fee refresher courses.
        <br><br> Videos of people talking about how Starfish stammering control training
        courses have changed their lives can be viewed <a href="/stories/">here</a>.<br><br>The
        Starfish Project is a project for training people who Stutter (Stammer) to
        both control and gain confidence over something that has controlled them.<br><br>It
        is not about trying to achieve the impossible of so-called ‘fluency’ – when
        no one in life is fluent. It is not about striving for perfection in an imperfect
        world.<br><br>Unfortunately, there is NO CURE for Stuttering (Stammering).
        However our training is specifically designed to give you the tools and the
        confidence to control your stutter in the day to day speaking situations that
        you will encounter.<br><br> Our training is on a one to one basis, given by
        recovering stammerers. It combines compassion and care with proven successful
        methods of diaphragmatic retraining (costal breathing), avoidance reduction
        therapy and positive attitude development.<br><br>We always limit the number
        of people on each course to ensure everyone receives the maximum individual
        attention.
